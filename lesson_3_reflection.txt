When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
remote repository is used when we want to collaborate with other developers or team member. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
pulling repository manually help know when did you made the sync to the repository and what changes occurred while syncing.updating 
git repository automatically would result in updating content of the repository without your knowing which could lead to confusion 
and chaos.
