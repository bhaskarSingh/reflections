How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it helped me in comparing the two file and finding the bug more easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    it could help me if I want to compare my previous version of the code ,to check the differnce and to 
	find the bug in the code.
*it help us in finding the bug in the program easily by comparing the two version of the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    saving the file manually is better I suppose cause it help us in creating unnecessary commit 
	but for non-coding purpose it is better if we save the file automatically in that case google 
	docs would be better.
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    for ex. if i changed a file in css its gone effect the html to so the git allows to commit multiple file 
	at a time for better progress and debuging reasons.but google dosc isn't made for the purpose of debuging the sode so 
	it saves the file separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to see the history of the file and gitt diff to compare the two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git version-control system help us to go back to the previous commits to find out the bug thus we can simply try to break (code)something to make something new more confidently. 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

i would use to for big to medium -small projects to work efficiently
